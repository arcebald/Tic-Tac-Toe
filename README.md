## Preview

This is a game of tic tac toe, with score counters, player's next move visualization and reset button.

## Technology used:

- I used vanilla javascript, css and html.
- I used some wireframe image and click sounds.


## Approach and solving for the winner:
The main approach to the game is creating div tags in index.html page and playing in java script with the properties of the class atribute 
to capture the clicked box. Iterating through the grid cells I captured the cell and added the class property either X or O to the div tag in HTML. I checked the all winner conditions with if-else statements. 
 
## Main features:
- Text changer.
- Player's score
- Audio for the tics.
- A reset button
