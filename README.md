## Preview

This is a game of tic tac toe starwars style, with score counter and icon changer.

## Technology used:

- I used vanilla javascript, css and html.
- I used some locally stored images and fonts, also some icons.


## Approach:
The main approach to the game is using 2d arrays to make information gathering a bit easy.
And for checking the win conditions i used loops and ternary operators to check each win condition.
### How i solved for the winner:
i saved the entire state of the game in a 2d array, then used loops to check each row if it has the same value then alerting an adding scores.

## Main features:
- Icon changer.
- Audio for the tics.
- A slightly dumb AI.### User Stories
